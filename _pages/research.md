<!-- From the vibrant colors in a display to the way solar panels capture energy, the function of these materials often comes down to how tiny molecules interact with each other and with light.  -->

At the PRISM Lab, we study how energy and electrical charges move within groups of molecules. Imagine molecules as tiny building blocks; when they **assemble in specific ways**, they can unlock brand new behaviors. Our research helps reveal how complex, real-world materials work, from advanced electronics to biological systems.

At its core, everything we study is about manipulating the **chemical potential**, a term that describes how much energy is available to drive chemical change. This potential is shaped by many factors, like what atoms are present, how molecules interact, their orientation, and even how tightly packed they are. Thus, a big part of our work involves developing creative ways to arrange molecules with exceptional precision, from tiny dots (0D) to intricate 3D structures, by exploiting innovative approaches, such as the curve of a surface or external triggers (like light or force) to fine-tune how molecules behave locally.

Our current research focuses on four interconnected areas:

<h5><b>1. Heavy Metal-Free Organic Photosensitizers and Photocatalysts</b></h5> <img src="/assets/img/Project1.jpg" alt="photosensitizer" style="width:30%; float: right; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;">

Sunlight can power chemical reactions that would otherwise be difficult or impossible. In nature, this concept drives essential processes such as photosynthesis. Inspired by this, we develop light-activated molecules, known as photosensitizers, that absorb light and use this energy to drive useful chemical transformations.

Instead of relying on rare metals, we design metal-free organic alternatives. By modifying simple, commercially available dyes, we control their electronic structure to promote efficient formation of excited states known as triplets. This approach minimizes energy loss and enables fast and selective chemical reactions under mild conditions.

<h5><b>2. Organic Room-Temperature Phosphors</b></h5> <img src="/assets/img/Project2.jpg" alt="RTP photo" style="width:14%; float: right; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;">

Room-temperature phosphorescence in organic materials has great potential for applications in imaging, sensing, and display technologies. However, organic compounds typically lose their energy as heat rather than light.

We address this challenge by introducing functional groups that both encourage triplet formation and participate in non-covalent interactions. These interactions limit molecular motion and reduce energy loss, making light emission more efficient. We also use molecular modeling to identify which motions need to be controlled and how to best suppress them through strategic design.

<h5><b>3. Functional Porous Materials</b></h5> <img src="/assets/img/Project3.jpg" alt="G-quadruplex Organic Framework" style="width:17%; float: right; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;">

In real-world materials, properties are shaped by how molecules come together. We use porous architectures as a platform to control the way molecules interact with each other in the solid state.

When molecules are spaced apart, they behave like isolated units and maintain their individual properties such as light absorption or chemical reactivity. When packed closely, they interact strongly, leading to new behaviors such as efficient charge transport or stabilization of high-energy intermediates. By designing porous materials with specific structural features, either uniform or gradually changing, we aim to control these interactions with precision.

We are particularly interested in using non-covalent interactions to build crystalline porous solids and in developing polymers with irregular backbones that resist stacking. These approaches support easier fabrication and recycling.

<h5><b>4. New Reaction Development and Mechanistic Investigation</b></h5>

Sulfur-containing organic compounds are highly versatile and play a key role in both natural and synthetic chemistry. From early Earth chemistry to modern metabolism, sulfur helps bridge inorganic and organic processes.

We develop new reactions that involve sulfur-based functional groups such as thiocarbonyls, thioesters, and thioamides. These methods are applied to the synthesis of chromophores, the creation of new polymers, and biocompatible molecular tools. We combine synthetic work with detailed studies of the underlying mechanisms to better understand how these reactions occur and how they can be accelerated.
