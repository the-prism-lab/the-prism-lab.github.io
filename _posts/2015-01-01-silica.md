This is an age-old question for people using MeOH in their flash chromatography.

Turns out, **methanol doesn't actually dissolve silica gel.** The "white stuff" you sometimes see is tiny silica particles (fines) breaking off, especially from granular silica when using DCM/MeOH gradients. Spherical silica seems better at holding its own. Have a look at an [interesting analysis](https://www.biotage.com/blog/how-much-methanol-can-i-use-with-my-silica-flash-column) conducted by Biotage.
