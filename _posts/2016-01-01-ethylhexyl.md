As a bit of a "purist", I've always had a mild aversion to 2-ethylhexyl substituents in my molecules, as it has an undefined stereogenic center at the 2 position. Molecules incorporating such a functionality thus are random mixtures(!) of (_R_)- and (_S_)-stereoisomers, not to mention molecules possessing multiple 2-ethylhexyl substituents.

For material scientists, particularly aromatic polymer chemists, however, 2-ethylhexyl is a go-to choice for boosting solubility, as its bulky nature effectively disrupts Ï€-stacking and aggregation. What's really striking is how ubiquitous 2-ethylhexyl-containing molecules are in our daily lives, far beyond the confines of research labs. It makes me wonder if their widespread use also hinges on their aggregation-modulating properties.

Just to name a few common examples:

- [2-ethylhexyl nitrate (2-EHN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetane_improver) is a crucial cetane improver for diesel fuels.
- [Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bis(2-ethylhexyl)_phthalate>), produced at about 3 billion kg/year, is a primary plasticizer for PVC.
- [Octocrylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octocrylene) and [octyl methoxycinnamate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octyl_methoxycinnamate) are key ingredients in sunscreen products, vital for absorbing UVB and UVA radiation.

Without a doubt, I should have given 2-ethylhexyl much more credit!
