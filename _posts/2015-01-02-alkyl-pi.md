The team led by Ken Shimizu at the University of South Carolina recently published a super interesting finding: the strength of attractive or repulsive forces in π-stacked aromatic molecules can be significantly influenced by their alkyl substituents.

What's cool is that it's not just about the size of those alkyl groups. If the **interacting surface area** between the aromatic rings is large enough, even molecules with bulky _tert_-butyl (*t*Bu) groups can show stronger attraction than those with smaller methyl (Me) groups!
