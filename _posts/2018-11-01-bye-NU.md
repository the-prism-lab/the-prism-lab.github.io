After a long period of job searching, I am delighted to share that I will be taking up a new post at Cardiff University, starting from January 2019. I am deeply indebted to all my mentors, colleagues, friends, and family for their unwavering help and support throughout this process.

My past six and a half years at Northwestern, focusing on photoenergy research, have been a truly wonderful experience. It was a genuine privilege to collaborate daily with some of the brightest minds (you know who you are!) and to have access to cutting-edge technologies. My perspectives on science and its interplay with education and society have grown and matured significantly during this time. These insights are truly the best gift I will carry with me across the Atlantic Ocean and eagerly pass on to my future coworkers.
