Anna’s first paper **Triplet-Forming Thionated Donor–Acceptor Chromophores for Electrochemically Amphoteric Photosensitization** was published on EurJOC (DOI: [10.1002/ejoc.202100793](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ejoc.202100793)). We demonstrated that triplet-state formation from thiocarbonyls derivatives is independent of the donor−acceptor interactions. Therefore, these electrochemically active thionated chromophores can be utilized as amphoteric, heavy-atom-free photoredox catalysts that display comparable catalytic activities to common inorganic photosensitizers.
