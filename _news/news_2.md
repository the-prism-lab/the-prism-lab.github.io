**Singlet fission in multi-crystalline diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives observed**. The nice work of Pat reports one of the first observations and thorough studies of singlet fission processes in DPP materials, a common class of industrial pigments. This work opens a new direction for SF study (DOI: [10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b10565](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b10565)).
