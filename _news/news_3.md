**DNA nucleobase to form crystalline porous organic frameworks**. Continuing our work of G-quadruplex-driven self-assembly, we found that the same strategy can be used to guide the formation of [highly crystalline organic frameworks consisted of segregated donor/acceptor chromophore pi-stacks](https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2689). The materials display, in addition to high porosity, facile carrier generation and mobility, and can be applied as the cathode material in lithium-ion batteries. The joint force of scientists from three departments ([Hupp/Farha](http://chemgroups.northwestern.edu/hupp/) @ Chem., [Snurr](http://www.iec.northwestern.edu/) @ Chem. Eng. and [Hersam](http://www.hersam-group.northwestern.edu/) @ Mat Sci.) made this work possible. Thanks, everyone!
