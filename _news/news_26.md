After nearly five years of work since the start of this project in early 2020, we are delighted to share that our manuscript has been published in *JACS*! This paper, **[A Single Bioorthogonal Reaction for Multiplex Cell Surface Protein Labeling](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c11701)**, reports a highly efficient method that can be seamlessly integrated with existing bioorthogonal reactions, enabling multi-target protein labeling using small-molecule fluorescent tags of different colors. This journey has been anything but smoothâ€”adapting to remote work during the pandemic, facing multiple rejections, and navigating several rounds of revisions. Yet, these challenges have only strengthened the quality and depth of our work. A heartfelt thank you to [Yu-Hsuan](https://tsai-lab.org/yu-hsuan-tsai/) and his team and colleagues at Shenzhen Bay for their dedication and perseverance. This achievement is a testament to the power of collaboration and resilience!
