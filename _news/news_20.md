Since we started dealing with more analytical or data-heavy projects, I decided to share some Python scripts here (check the [Python Notebook](https://blogs.cardiff.ac.uk/team-wu/python-notebooks/) tab). They can be executed online using Googleâ€™s cloud computing resources (Google Colab). The initial releases are some short scripts for fitting the kinetic data or simulating the product ratio of competing reactions. More to come, stay tuned!
