**Heterogeneous Super-reductant**. Radical anion excited states can provide remarkably negative reducing potentials for carrying out a variety of difficult reductions. Collaborating with the [Farha](https://sites.northwestern.edu/omarkfarha/) group, we built this capability into a MOF structure that preserves the ability of naphthalene diimide radical anion excited states to reduce dichloromethane at a potential near â€“2.1 V vs. SCE (DOI: [10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00720](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b00720)). This work was the most read article of *Chem. Mater.* in April.
