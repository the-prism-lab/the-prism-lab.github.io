YLW welcomes **Chenyang Wu** to join the group. Developing bond-forming reactions with extraordinary efficiency and selectivity provides powerful tools for chemical modification. Chenyang will be expanding the scope of and enhancing the reactivity of a ‘bioorthogonal’ thiazoline-forming reaction. This project is joint by a long-time friend and collaborator [Dr. Y.-H. Tsai](https://tsai-lab.org/yu-hsuan-tsai/) at Shenzhen Bay Laboratory.
