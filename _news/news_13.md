As the school partially reopens to provide a hybrid model of education this autumn, I guess this is what I will be wearing in the next couple of months.

<div class="row mt-3">
  <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center">
    {% include figure.liquid
      path="assets/img/IMG_6116-scaled.jpg" 
      alt="Wearing mask for hybrid education"
      width="150" 
      class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 mx-auto d-block"
      zoomable=true
    %}
  </div>
</div>
