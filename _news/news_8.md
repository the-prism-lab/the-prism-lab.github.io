After the first semester in Cardiff, Yi-Lin enjoyed the break by presenting in four conferences at ETH Zurich, Cardiff University, University of Liverpool, and RSC Burlington House. It was great to interact with the scientific giants, interact with researchers in various fields, and reunite with old friends. Thank you, Fran√ßois.
