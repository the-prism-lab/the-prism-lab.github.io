YLW will be helping with the management and event coordination at Cardiff Scientific Society. CSS hosts [**12 public lectures**](https://www.cardiffscientificsociety.org/programme.htm) annually, where leading researchers break down cutting-edge science into accessible talks for everyone. This initiative brings back fond memories of the "[Prospects](https://youtube.com/channel/UC_hbp-t_rkJ8csJRllMfnzQ?si=VC2y_0l8JuupnE14)" science lecture series, which I highly appreciated and thoroughly enjoyed during my years at NTU. If you are around Cardiff, come and join our lectures!
