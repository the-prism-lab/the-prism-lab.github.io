However, means for their covalent conjugation to the target proteins limit applications in multicolor imaging. Here, we identify 2-[(alkylthio)(aryl)methylene]malononitrile (TAMM) molecules reacting with 1,2-aminothiol at a labeling rate over 104 M–1 s–1 through detailed mechanistic investigation. The fast TAMM molecules and mild reaction conditions enable site-specific labeling of surface proteins in not only cell lines but also primary neurons and living mice. The combination of genetic code expansion and sequence-specific proteolytic cleavage enables selective modification of three different cell surface proteins through iterative TAMM condensation. TAMM condensation is also compatible with Cu-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition and tetrazine ligation for four-color fluorescent labeling, reaching the maximum available colors of conventional confocal microscopes. Thus, bioconjugation chemistry is no longer the limiting factor for multiplex cell surface protein imaging.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="williams_secondary_2024" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Secondary Amine Catalysis in Enzyme Design: Broadening Protein Template Diversity through Genetic Code Expansion</div> <div class="author"> Thomas L.

However, existing methods, predominantly reliant on modified ligands or N-terminal prolines, impose significant limitations on template selection. In this study, genetic code expansion was used to break this boundary, enabling secondary amines to be incorporated into alternative proteins and positions of choice. Pyrrolysine analogues carrying different secondary amines could be incorporated into superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), multidrug-binding LmrR and nucleotide-binding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Notably, the analogue containing a D-proline moiety demonstrated both proteolytic stability and catalytic activity, conferring LmrR and DHFR with the desired transfer hydrogenation activity. While the LmrR variants were confined to the biomimetic 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) as the hydride source, the optimal DHFR variant favorably used the pro-R hydride from NADPH for stereoselective reactions (e.r. up to 92 : 8), highlighting that a switch of protein template could broaden the nucleophile option for catalysis. Owing to the cofactor compatibility, the DHFR-based secondary amine catalysis could be integrated into an enzymatic recycling scheme. This established method shows substantial potential in enzyme design, applicable from studies on enzyme evolution to the development of new biocatalysts.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="chen_selective_2024" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Selective Protein Degradation through Tetrazine Ligation of Genetically Incorporated Unnatural Amino Acids</div> <div class="author"> Jinghao Chen, Gaocan Dai, Shixiang Duan, Yang Huang, Yi‐Lin Wu, Zhiyong Xie, and Yu‐Hsuan Tsai </div> <div class="periodical"> <i>Chem.

Here, we show that genetically incorporated unnatural amino acids bearing a strained alkene or alkyne functionality can act as a minimalist tag for targeted protein degradation. Specifically, we observed the degradation of strained alkene‐ or alkyne‐containing kinases and E2 ubiquitin‐conjugating enzymes upon treatment with hydrophobic tetrazine conjugates. The extent of the induced protein degradation depends on the identity of the target protein, unnatural amino acid, and tetrazine conjugate, as well as the site of the unnatural amino acid in the target protein. Mechanistic studies revealed proteins undergo proteasomal degradation after tetrazine tethering, and the identity of tetrazine conjugates influences the dependence of ubiquitination on protein degradation. This work provides an alternative approach for targeted protein degradation and mechanistic insight, facilitating the future development of more effective targeted protein degradation strategies.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="wu_why_2023" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Why does thionating a carbonyl molecule make it a better electron acceptor?</div> <div class="author"> Yi-Lin Wu and Anna I.

The success of these applications originates from thiocarbonyl’s small optical gap in the visible region and the enhanced electron affinity compared to the carbonyl analogues (R2C[double bond, length as m-dash]O). Although these observations seem to be contrary to the implication based on a simple electronegativity consideration (2.58 for sulfur and 3.44 for oxygen), a natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis gives a straightforward explanation for the LUMO-lowering effect of C[double bond, length as m-dash]O → C[double bond, length as m-dash]S substitution. In comparison to the valence (2p)C/(2p)O interactions in C[double bond, length as m-dash]O, the higher 3p orbital of sulfur and its weaker overlap with the 2p level of carbon result in a weaker antibonding interaction in Image ID:d2cp05186a-t1.gif NBO, a prominent contributor to the LUMO. Such an analysis also provides a semi-quantitative understanding of the electronic effect of substituents on or in π-conjugation with a (thio)carbonyl functionality. The intuitive concepts uncovered here offer a simple rule to predict the electronic properties of π-conjugated molecules that incorporate heavy heteroelements and would facilitate materials development.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="wright_synthesis_2023" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Synthesis, solid-state structure, and electrochemical properties of thienodipyrimidine-2,4,5,7-tetra(thi)ones</div> <div class="author"> Anna I.

Here we report a simple, efficient, and general strategy for multiple C-H/N-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISanion hydrogen bond enhanced pi-pi interaction directed 2D oriented self-assembly in water, which is based on the head-to-tail association of perylene monoimide dimers (PMIs) by directing N-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISanion interactions to position the anions to the C-H of pi systems (PMIs). Interesting, this behavior only occurs for size-matched anions (Cl- to NO3-; \textless45 angstrom(3)), while larger anions could not form 2D crystalline nanosheet superstructures. The results show that crystalline nanosheet superstructures with precise distance control of surface charges can effectively capture DNA, possibly due to their high surface charge density and the distance match between the distance of surface charges and the distance between adjacent base pairs.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="wright_triplet-forming_2021" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Triplet-Forming Thionated Donor-Acceptor Chromophores for Electrochemically Amphoteric Photosensitization</div> <div class="author"> Anna I.

The physical properties of the chromophores were studied by spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements and DFT calculations. Relative to their non-thionated counterparts, the thionated D-A chromophores display enhanced visible-light absorption and O-1(2)-sensitization quantum yields and negligible fluorescence, suggesting facile triplet formation of this class of molecules. This behavior originates from the significant n-pi* character in the singlet excited state, resulting in large spin-orbit coupling between the singlet/triplet manifolds regardless of the degree of D/A interactions. With the electrochemically active D/A moieties and high triplet energy, the thionated chromophores can be used as amphoteric photosensitizers to catalyze reductive and oxidative photoreactions with efficiency comparable to Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) as the sensitizer. Our results demonstrate that thiocarbonylation can be utilized in amide/imide-containing D-A chromophores to provide a wide range of heavy-atom-free redox-active photosensitizers.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="zhou_organic_2020" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Organic room-temperature phosphorescence from halogen-bonded organic frameworks: hidden electronic effects in rigidified chromophores</div> <div class="author"> Jiawang Zhou, Ljiljana Stojanović, Andrey A.

While molecular solids were found to suppress non-radiative energy dissipation and make the RTP process kinetically favourable, such an effect should be enhanced by the presence of multivalent directional non-covalent interactions. Here we report phosphorescence of a series of fast triplet-forming tetraethyl naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylates. Various numbers of bromo substituents were introduced to modulate intermolecular halogen-bonding interactions. Bright RTP with quantum yields up to 20% was observed when the molecule is surrounded by a Brcdots, three dots, centeredO halogen-bonded network. Spectroscopic and computational analyses revealed that judicious heavy-atom positioning suppresses non-radiative relaxation and enhances intersystem crossing at the same time. The latter effect was found to be facilitated by the orbital angular momentum change, in addition to the conventional heavy-atom effect. Our results suggest the potential of multivalent non-covalent interactions for excited-state conformation and electronic control.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="del_prado_functional_2020" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Functional Systems Derived from Nucleobase Self-assembly</div> <div class="author"> Anselmo Prado, David González-Rodríguez, and Yi-Lin Wu </div> <div class="periodical"> <i>ChemistryOpen</i> <b>2020</b>, <i>9</i>, 409–430.<span class="doi"> (DOI:10.1002/open.201900363)</span> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/open.201900363" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Link</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Dynamic and reversible non-covalent interactions endow synthetic systems and materials with smart adaptive functions that allow them to response to diverse stimuli, interact with external agents, or repair structural defects.

Two sets of complementary purine-pyrimidine pairs (guanine:cytosine and adenine:thymine(uracil)) are available that provide selective and directional H-bonding interactions, present multiple metal-coordination sites, and exhibit rich redox chemistry.

Triisopropylsilyl- (TIPS) or H-terminated ethynyl groups are used to tune the singlet and triplet energies to enable their potential applications in singlet fission and triplet fusion processes. Time-resolved optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies are used to obtain a mechanistic understanding of triplet formation. The anthanthrene derivatives form triplet states efficiently at a rate (ca. 107 s−1) comparable to radiative singlet fluorescence processes with approximately 30 % triplet yields, despite their large S1-T1 energy gap (&gt;1 eV) and the lack of carbonyl groups. In contrast, anthanthrone has a higher triplet yield (50±10 %) with a faster intersystem crossing rate (2.7urn:x-wiley:21926506:media:cplu201900410:cplu201900410-math-0001 108 s−1) because of the n-π* character of the S1←S0 transition. Analysis of time-resolved spin-polarized EPR spectra of these compounds reveals that the triplet states are primarily generated by the spin-orbit-induced intersystem crossing mechanism. However, at high concentrations, the EPR spectrum of the 4,6,10,14-tetrakis(TIPS-ethynyl)anthanthrene triplet state shows a significant contribution from a non-Boltzmann population of the ms=0 spin sublevel, which is characteristic of triplet formation by singlet fission.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="bae_substituent_2019" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Substituent effects on energetics and crystal morphology modulate singlet fission in 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracenes</div> <div class="author"> Youn Jue Bae, Joseph A.

Fluoro and methoxy substituents at the 4- and 4’-positions of the BPEA phenyl groups control the intermolecular packing in the crystal structure, which alters the interchromophore electronic coupling, while also changing the SF energetics. The lowest excited singlet state (S1) energy of 4,4’-difluoro-BPEA is higher than that of BPEA so that the increased thermodynamic favorability of SF results in a (16 +/- 2 ps)(-1) SF rate and a 180% +/- 16% triplet yield, which is about an order of magnitude faster than BPEA with a comparable triplet yield. By contrast, 4-fluoro-4’-methoxy-BPEA and 4,4’-dimethoxy-BPEA have slower SF rates, (90 +/- 20 ps)(-1) and (120 +/- 10 ps)(-1), and lower triplet yields, (110 +/- 4)% and (168 +/- 7)%, respectively, than 4,4’-difluoro-BPEA.

We demonstrate the use of transient two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (t-2DES) to probe coherences in an electron donor-acceptor dyad consisting of a perylenediimide (PDI) acceptor and a perylene (Per) donor. An actinic pump pulse prepares the lowest excited singlet state of PDI followed by formation of the PDI(*-)-Per(*+) ion pair, which is probed at different times following the actinic pulse using 2DES.

The properties of the nucleoside EG-H2 are only weakly perturbed upon incorporation into synthetic DNA hairpins in which thymine, cytosine or adenine are the bases flanking EG. Incorporation of the nucleoside to be adjacent to guanine or deazaguanine results in the formation of short-lived (40-80 ps) exciplexes, the charge transfer character of which increases as the oxidn. potential of the donor decreases. Hairpins possessing two or three adjacent EG base analogs display exciton-coupled CD in the ground state and form long-lived fluorescent excited states upon electronic excitation. Incorporation of EG into the helical scaffold of the DNA hairpins places it adjacent to its neighboring nucleobases or a second EG, thus providing the close proximity required for the formation of exciplex or excimer intermediates upon geometric relaxation of the short-lived EG excited state. The three time-resolved spectroscopic methods employed permit both the characterization of the several intermediates and the kinetics of their formation and decay.

This study demonstrates the effect of heavy chalcogen substitution within a porous framework for the modulation of photocatalytic activity.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="brown_tracking_2017" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Tracking Hole Transport in DNA Hairpins Using a Phenylethynylguanine Nucleobase</div> <div class="author"> Kristen E.

The nearly indistinguishable oxidn. potentials of EG and G and unique spectroscopic characteristics of EG+.bul. make it well-suited for directly observing transient hole occupation during charge transport between a stilbene electron donor and acceptor. In contrast to the cation radical G+.bul., EG+.bul. possesses a strong absorption near 460 nm and has a distinct Raman-active ethynyl stretch. Both spectroscopic characteristics are easily distinguished from those of the stilbene donor/acceptor radical ion chromophores. Here, employing EG, we obsd. its role as a shallow hole trap, or as an intermediate hole transport site when a deeper trap state was present. Using a combination of ultrafast absorption and stimulated Raman spectroscopies, the hole-transport dynamics were obsd. to be similar in systems having EG vs. G bases, with small perturbations to the charge transport rates and yields. These results showed that EG can be deployed at specified locations throughout the sequence to report on hole occupancy, thereby enabling detailed monitoring of the hole transport dynamics with base-site specificity.

To elucidate substituent effects on SF, we have measured the SF dynamics and triplet yields of thin films, formed by Tet bearing hydrogen (H), Me (Me), fluoro (F), and trimethylsilyl (TMS) substituents on the p-Ph positions and on the 3 and 9 positions of the tetracene core, by time-resolved spectroscopy in the vis-NIR and IR regions. The H-, Me-, and F-Tet display strong intramol. electronic coupling (π-π distances \textless4 Å), and SF gives high triplet exciton yields up to 200% (quant.). In addn., a charge-transfer state mediates SF in F-Tet films, while H-Tet and Me-Tet show no evidence for such a state. Correlations between the SF yields and the crystal structure show that chromophore slippage along both their short and long axes allows efficient SF and that a large degree of π contact between the chromophores is not necessary for rapid and efficient SF in the solid state. As expected, the large interchromophore distance in TMS-Tet (\textgreater4 Å) reduces its SF triplet yield to about 60%.

Unlike many SF chromophores, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) conforms to these criteria, and here we investigate SF in DPP for the first time. SF yields in thin films of DPP derivs., which are widely used in org. electronics and photovoltaics, are shown to depend critically on crystal morphol. Time-resolved spectroscopy of three DPP derivs. with Ph (3,6-diphenylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione, PhDPP), thienyl (3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione, TDPP), and phenylthienyl (3,6-di(5-phenylthiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione, PhTDPP) arom. substituents in 100-200 nm thin films reveals that efficient SF occurs only in TDPP and PhTDPP (τSF = 220 ± 20 ps), despite the fact that SF is most exoergic in PhDPP. This result correlates well with the greater degree of π-overlap and closer π-stacking in TDPP (3.50 Å) and PhTDPP (3.59 Å) relative to PhDPP (3.90 Å) and demonstrates that SF in DPP is highly sensitive to the electronic coupling between adjacent chromophores. The triplet yield in PhTDPP films is detd. to be 210 ± 35% by the singlet depletion method and 165 ± 30% by the energy transfer method, showing that SF is nearly quant. in these films and that DPP derivs. are a promising class of SF chromophores for enhancing photovoltaic performance.

In the presence of KPF6 in tetrahydrofuran (THE), 1 self-assembles into a monodisperse, C-4-symmetric GQ:1 with small spatial intraquadruplex overlap between the ANI-NDI units. Photoexcitation of monomeric 1 induces the two-step charge transfer GEAn-1*ANI-NDI -\textgreater GEAn(+center dot)-ANI(-center dot)-NDI -\textgreater GEAn(+center dot)-ANI-NDI-center dot that occurs in tau(CSI) = 5 ps and tau(CS2) = 330 ps, respectively, while charge recombination in ca. 300 ns. Sharpening of the GEAn(+center dot) transient absorption and a shift of the ethynyl vibrational frequency in 1 were observed, concomitant with the stepwise electron transfer from ANI(-center dot) to NDI. Formation of GQ:1 from 1 in THE increases the secondary charge-shifting rate (tau(CS2) = 110 ps) and results in no change in ethynyl vibrational frequency. Charge recombination in GQ:1 is slowed by enhanced radical-pair intersystem crossing driven by the greater number of hyperfine couplings in the assembly. Moreover, time-resolved EPR spectroscopy shows that the spin spin-exchange interaction (J) between the radicals of GEAn(+center dot)-ANI-NDI-center dot within GQ-1 is smaller than that of 1, suggesting that the spin (charge) density in GEAn(+center dot) is more dispersed in GQ-1. The spectroscopic results are consistent with hole sharing among the guanines within the G-quadruplex that is kinetically competitive with the formation of GEAn(+center dot). This suggests that G-quadruplexes can serve as effective hole conduits in ordered donor-acceptor assemblies.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="margulies_sub-picosecond_2015" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Sub-Picosecond Singlet Exciton Fission in Cyano-Substituted Diaryltetracenes</div> <div class="author"> Eric A.

As a result of tuning the triplet-state energy, SF is faster in TcCN relative to the corresponding endoergic process in tetracene. SF proceeds with two time consts. in the film samples (τ=0.8±0.2 ps and τ=23±3 ps), which is attributed to structural disorder within the film giving rise to one population with a favorable interchromophore geometry, which undergoes rapid SF, and a second population in which the initially formed singlet exciton must diffuse to a site at which this favorable geometry exists.

Two sym. PMI trefoils were synthesized by connecting the 9-position of the perylene core either directly (1) or through a phenylene linker (2) to the 1,3,5-positions of a central benzene ring. Synchrotron-based small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering measurements in methylcyclohexane show that trefoil 1 self-assembles into cofacial trimers (13) on av., while trefoil 2 forms much larger assemblies that are tridecamers (213) on av. Their photophysics were characterized using steady-state as well as transient absorption and emission spectroscopy. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals that both 13 and 213 initially form excitonically coupled excited states that subsequently relax to excimer states having 20 and 8.4 ns lifetimes, resp., which decay to ground-state primarily nonradiatively. The data are consistent with stronger electronic coupling between the PMI mols. in 213 relative to 13.

A monodisperse, C-4-symmetric octamer of a guanine-perylene-3,4,9,10-bis(dicarboximide) conjugate (GPDI) was prepared in tetrahydrofuran. The two layers of cyclic guanine tetramers have the same direction of rotation, and the PDI moiety between the layers adopts a nearly eclipsed relationship (H-aggregation), as revealed by small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering, NMR spectroscopy, and steady-state UV/vis absorption. Following photoexcitation of the PDI moiety in the quadruplex, charge separation occurs in tau(CS) = 98 +/- 12 ps to give G(+center dot)-PDI-center dot that recombines in tau(CR) = 1.2 +/- 0.2 ns, which is \textgreater100 times longer than that in the monomeric GPDI dyad. The transient absorption spectrum of G(+center dot)-PDI-center dot within the GPDI quadruplex suggests the formation of a radical anion delocalized over the neighboring PDI units, and this result is consistent with the more favorable electrochemical reduction potential for PDIs in the quadruplex relative to the monomer.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2012</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="tancini_11-dicyano-4-4-diethylaminophenylbuta-13-dienes_2012" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">1,1-Dicyano-4-[4-(diethylamino)phenyl]buta-1,3-dienes: Structure-Property Relationships</div> <div class="author"> Francesca Tancini, Yi-Lin Wu, W.

The pos. charge on the DMA rings, and in particular their NMe2 centers, is evidenced by complexation with a tetraphosphonate cavitand. The startling and unexpected optical similarity between squaraines and a product, formed via a cumulene-like cyclodimerization of butatriene, indicates the potential application of push-pull [4]radialenes as a new class of dyes with absorptions close to or in the NIR, but with lower polarity and higher soly.

These novel chromophores are strong electron acceptors and undergo facile one-electron reductions at potentials (-0.09 to -0.17 eV vs. Fc(+)/Fc, in CH(2)Cl(2)-0.1 M (n)Bu(4)NPF(6)) lower than those reported for the benchmark organic acceptors, such as TCNE (-0.32 eV) and 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) (-0.25 eV). The electron-accepting power of one octacyano[4]dendralene, as expressed by the computed adiabatic electron affinity (EA), compares to that of the reference acceptor 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F(4)-TCNQ) used as a p-type dopant in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and solar cells. Gas-phase density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict a stretched-out conformation as the global energy minimum for octacyano[4]dendralenes. In the solid state however, folded conformations were observed for two structures by X-ray analysis. Taking the solid state environment approximately into account calculations predict a energetical degeneracy between the stretched-out and folded conformation.

The scope of this reaction is established by both varying the nucleophilic and electrophilic components. Electrochem. studies show that the CT properties of these systems are readily tunable by substitution on the electrophile, which has the largest effect on the LUMO. Non-reversible redn. potentials range from ca.-1.2 to -1.9 V in CH2Cl2, against the ferricinium/ferrocene couple (Fc+/Fc) according to cyclovoltammetry and rotating disk voltammetry. The chromophores show a significant non-planarity between the N,N-dimethylanilino donor and the 1,1-dicyanovinyl acceptor moieties, with torsional angles around 40° from X-ray anal., but retain strong quinoidal character. The mechanism of this reaction has been studied computational using d. functional methods in the gas-phase and using the polarizable continuum model for addressing solvent effects. The complete reaction free-energy profile has been detd. for the reaction of 1,1-dicyanoethene and 4-ethynyl-N,N-dimethylaniline. The process proceeds through formal [2+2] cycloaddn. followed by retro-electrocyclization. The formation of a zwitterionic intermediate in the cycloaddn. step is shown.

The instability of the polarized reactants precluded the use of the Huisgen reaction and alternative synthetic methodologies were employed. Charge-transfer absorptions between an N,N-dimethylanilino and a dicyanovinyl group are modest to strong, with maxima from λmax = 400 to 453 nm depending on substituent positioning. Time-dependent d. functional B3LYP/6-31G(d) calcns. are within 0.6 eV of expt. and assign these bands as HOMO-LUMO transitions.
