Here we report photodriven ET rates in a pair of donor-acceptor (D-A) compounds that link one anthracene (An) donor to one or two equivalent 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) acceptors. Subpicosecond ET from the lowest excited singlet state of An to two BQs is about 2.4 times faster than ET to one BQ at room temperature, but about 5 times faster at cryogenic temperatures. This factor of 2 increase results from a transition from ET to one of two acceptors at room temperature to ET to a superposition state of the two acceptors with correlated system-bath fluctuations at low temperature.},

We report on the energy and electron transfer behavior of chlorophyll-based para- and meta-linked donor-bridge acceptor (D-B-A) dyads, where the semisynthetic chlorophyll a derivative, zinc methyl 3-ethyl-pyrochlorophyllide a (D), is covalently attached at its 20-position to the para position of one phenyl of diphenylacetylene (B). The meta or para position of the phenyl in B distal to the donor is in turn attached to perylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (PDI) (A). Photoexcitation of the D-B-A dyads produces long-lived radical ion pairs D center dot+-B-A(center dot-), which recombine to the ground state and to both (3)*D-B-A and D-B-(3)*A. Time-resolved optical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies were used to monitor the charge transfer and triplet energy transfer (TEnT) processes. At longer times, TEnT occurs from 3*D-B-A to D-B-(3)*A. Surprisingly, the D-B-A molecules linked via the meta linkage exhibit faster CS, CR, and TEnT rates than do those with the para linkage in contrast to most other meta/para-linked D-B-A molecules previously examined.},

Here we report phosphorescence of a series of fast triplet-forming tetraethyl naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylates. Various numbers of bromo substituents were introduced to modulate intermolecular halogen-bonding interactions. Bright RTP with quantum yields up to 20\% was observed when the molecule is surrounded by a Brcdots, three dots, centeredO halogen-bonded network. Spectroscopic and computational analyses revealed that judicious heavy-atom positioning suppresses non-radiative relaxation and enhances intersystem crossing at the same time. The latter effect was found to be facilitated by the orbital angular momentum change, in addition to the conventional heavy-atom effect. Our results suggest the potential of multivalent non-covalent interactions for excited-state conformation and electronic control.},

Electronic interactions between the NDI units probed by absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopies, electrochemistry and theoretical calculations are shown to be weak. Photoexcitation of NDI leads to intracage charge separation with a longer lifetime than observed in the corresponding monomeric NDI and dimeric NDI cyclophane imines. The EPR spectrum of the singly reduced cage shows that the electron is localized on a single NDI unit at ambient temperatures and transitions to rapid hopping among all three NDI units upon heating to 350 K. Dynamic covalent chemistry thus promises rapid access to covalent organic cages with well-defined architectures to study charge accumulation and electron transport phenomena.},

The two layers of cyclic guanine tetramers have the same direction of rotation, and the PDI moiety between the layers adopts a nearly eclipsed relationship (H-aggregation), as revealed by small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering, NMR spectroscopy, and steady-state UV/vis absorption. Following photoexcitation of the PDI moiety in the quadruplex, charge separation occurs in tau(CS) = 98 +/- 12 ps to give G(+center dot)-PDI-center dot that recombines in tau(CR) = 1.2 +/- 0.2 ns, which is {\textgreater}100 times longer than that in the monomeric GPDI dyad. The transient absorption spectrum of G(+center dot)-PDI-center dot within the GPDI quadruplex suggests the formation of a radical anion delocalized over the neighboring PDI units, and this result is consistent with the more favorable electrochemical reduction potential for PDIs in the quadruplex relative to the monomer.},

In the presence of KPF6 in tetrahydrofuran (THE), 1 self-assembles into a monodisperse, C-4-symmetric GQ:1 with small spatial intraquadruplex overlap between the ANI-NDI units. Photoexcitation of monomeric 1 induces the two-step charge transfer GEAn-1*ANI-NDI -{\textgreater} GEAn(+center dot)-ANI(-center dot)-NDI -{\textgreater} GEAn(+center dot)-ANI-NDI-center dot that occurs in tau(CSI) = 5 ps and tau(CS2) = 330 ps, respectively, while charge recombination in ca. 300 ns. Sharpening of the GEAn(+center dot) transient absorption and a shift of the ethynyl vibrational frequency in 1 were observed, concomitant with the stepwise electron transfer from ANI(-center dot) to NDI. Formation of GQ:1 from 1 in THE increases the secondary charge-shifting rate (tau(CS2) = 110 ps) and results in no change in ethynyl vibrational frequency. Charge recombination in GQ:1 is slowed by enhanced radical-pair intersystem crossing driven by the greater number of hyperfine couplings in the assembly. Moreover, time-resolved EPR spectroscopy shows that the spin spin-exchange interaction (J) between the radicals of GEAn(+center dot)-ANI-NDI-center dot within GQ-1 is smaller than that of 1, suggesting that the spin (charge) density in GEAn(+center dot) is more dispersed in GQ-1. The spectroscopic results are consistent with hole sharing among the guanines within the G-quadruplex that is kinetically competitive with the formation of GEAn(+center dot). This suggests that G-quadruplexes can serve as effective hole conduits in ordered donor-acceptor assemblies.},

The properties of the nucleoside EG-H2 are only weakly perturbed upon incorporation into synthetic DNA hairpins in which thymine, cytosine or adenine are the bases flanking EG. Incorporation of the nucleoside to be adjacent to guanine or deazaguanine results in the formation of short-lived (40-80 ps) exciplexes, the charge transfer character of which increases as the oxidn. potential of the donor decreases. Hairpins possessing two or three adjacent EG base analogs display exciton-coupled CD in the ground state and form long-lived fluorescent excited states upon electronic excitation. Incorporation of EG into the helical scaffold of the DNA hairpins places it adjacent to its neighboring nucleobases or a second EG, thus providing the close proximity required for the formation of exciplex or excimer intermediates upon geometric relaxation of the short-lived EG excited state.

Two spherulite macromol. cryst. phases (banded and non-banded) were obsd. through concn. dependent, soln. processing techniques and were birefringent with a neg. sign of elongation. A dramatic change in the electronic absorption from blue in amorphous films to green in spherulites was obsd., and the mol. orientation was detd. through the combined anal. of polarized light microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and SEM. FsTA was performed on amorphous films and showed complex charge recombination dynamics, and a Stark effect, characterized from the combined TPA+ ̇and [BT-CN]- ̇spectroscopic signatures at 450 nm and 510 nm and identified through spectroelectrochem. Radical cation dynamics of TPA+ ̇were obsd. selectively at 750 nm with {\textgreater}503.3 ps (18\%) recombination kinetics resulting in a rather significant yield of free charge carriers in amorphous films and consistent with previous reports on energetically disordered blend films. However, photoexcitation on large, non-banded spherulites areas ({\textgreater}250 μm) reveal av. monoexponential charge recombination lifetimes of 169.2 ps from delocalized states similar to those obsd. in amorphous films and are 5× longer-lived than previous reports [Chang et al., J.

Thus, the correlation between the microstructure of the blend film and the photoinduced radical pair dynamics described here is crit. for developing a fundamental understanding of how dipolar states contribute to the charge carrier yield in a disordered energy system.

SF proceeds with two time consts. in the film samples (τ=0.8±0.2 ps and τ=23±3 ps), which is attributed to structural disorder within the film giving rise to one population with a favorable interchromophore geometry, which undergoes rapid SF, and a second population in which the initially formed singlet exciton must diffuse to a site at which this favorable geometry exists.

Unlike many SF chromophores, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) conforms to these criteria, and here we investigate SF in DPP for the first time. SF yields in thin films of DPP derivs., which are widely used in org. electronics and photovoltaics, are shown to depend critically on crystal morphol. Time-resolved spectroscopy of three DPP derivs. with Ph (3,6-diphenylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione, PhDPP), thienyl (3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione, TDPP), and phenylthienyl (3,6-di(5-phenylthiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione, PhTDPP) arom. substituents in 100-200 nm thin films reveals that efficient SF occurs only in TDPP and PhTDPP (τSF = 220 ± 20 ps), despite the fact that SF is most exoergic in PhDPP. This result correlates well with the greater degree of π-overlap and closer π-stacking in TDPP (3.50 Å) and PhTDPP (3.59 Å) relative to PhDPP (3.90 Å) and demonstrates that SF in DPP is highly sensitive to the electronic coupling between adjacent chromophores. The triplet yield in PhTDPP films is detd. to be 210 ± 35\% by the singlet depletion method and 165 ± 30\% by the energy transfer method, showing that SF is nearly quant. in these films and that DPP derivs. are a promising class of SF chromophores for enhancing photovoltaic performance.

The anthanthrene derivatives form triplet states efficiently at a rate (ca. 107 s−1) comparable to radiative singlet fluorescence processes with approximately 30 % triplet yields, despite their large S1-T1 energy gap (>1 eV) and the lack of carbonyl groups.

Fluoro and methoxy substituents at the 4- and 4'-positions of the BPEA phenyl groups control the intermolecular packing in the crystal structure, which alters the interchromophore electronic coupling, while also changing the SF energetics. The lowest excited singlet state (S1) energy of 4,4'-difluoro-BPEA is higher than that of BPEA so that the increased thermodynamic favorability of SF results in a (16 +/- 2 ps)(-1) SF rate and a 180\% +/- 16\% triplet yield, which is about an order of magnitude faster than BPEA with a comparable triplet yield. By contrast, 4-fluoro-4'-methoxy-BPEA and 4,4'-dimethoxy-BPEA have slower SF rates, (90 +/- 20 ps)(-1) and (120 +/- 10 ps)(-1), and lower triplet yields, (110 +/- 4)\% and (168 +/- 7)\%, respectively, than 4,4'-difluoro-BPEA.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that both complexes have a sandwich-like structure, wherein one [PMo12O40](3-) trianion is encapsulated by the primary faces of two CD tori through intermolecular [C-H center dot center dot center dot O-Mo] interactions. X-ray crystal superstructures of CD-POM-1 and CD-POM-2 show also that both of these 2:1 complexes are lined up longitudinally in a one-dimensional columnar fashion by means of [O-H center dot center dot center dot O] interactions. A beneficial nanoconfinement-induced stabilizing effect is supported by the observation of slow color changes for these supermolecules in aqueous solution phase. Electrochemical studies show that the redox properties of [PMo12O40](3-) trianions encapsulated by CDs in the complexes are largely preserved in solution. The supramolecular complementarity between the CDs and the [PMo12O40](3-) trianion provides yet another opportunity for the functionalization of POMs under mild conditions by using host-guest chemistry.},

We demonstrate the use of transient two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (t-2DES) to probe coherences in an electron donor-acceptor dyad consisting of a perylenediimide (PDI) acceptor and a perylene (Per) donor. An actinic pump pulse prepares the lowest excited singlet state of PDI followed by formation of the PDI(*-)-Per(*+) ion pair, which is probed at different times following the actinic pulse using 2DES.

	abstract = {DNA G-quadruplex structures were recently discovered to provide reliable scaffolding for two-dimensional organic frameworks due to the strong hydrogen-bonding ability of guanine. Herein, 2,7-diaryl pyrene building blocks with high HOMO energies and large optical gaps are incorporated into G-quadruplex organic frameworks. The adjustable substitution on the aryl groups provides an opportunity to elucidate the framework formation mechanism; molecular non-planarity is found to be beneficial for restricting interlayer slippage, and the framework crystallinity is highest when intermolecular interaction and non-planarity strike a fine balance. When guanine-functionalized pyrenes are co-crystallized with naphthalene diimide, charge-transfer (CT) complexes are obtained. The photophysical properties of the pyrene-only and CT frameworks are characterized by UV/Vis and steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopies, and by EPR spectroscopy for the CT complex frameworks.},

Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy shows that singlet fission is more rapid in smaller NPs, likely reflecting their greater surface area-to-vol. ratio and consequent exposure of more mols. to the high dielec. aq. environment. These observations suggest that charge transfer states, whose energy is sensitive to the dielec. const. of the surrounding medium, serve as virtual intermediates in PhTDPP NP singlet fission. However, the lifetime of the triplet excitons produced by singlet fission is longest in the larger NPs having greater long-range order, which allows the triplet excitons to diffuse further from one another thus slowing triplet-triplet annihilation.

	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed a surge of biomedical and materials applications of thiocarbonyl molecules (R2C[double bond, length as m-dash]S), such as in photodynamic therapy, organic field-effect transistors, and rechargeable batteries. The success of these applications originates from thiocarbonyl's small optical gap in the visible region and the enhanced electron affinity compared to the carbonyl analogues (R2C[double bond, length as m-dash]O). Although these observations seem to be contrary to the implication based on a simple electronegativity consideration (2.58 for sulfur and 3.44 for oxygen), a natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis gives a straightforward explanation for the LUMO-lowering effect of C[double bond, length as m-dash]O → C[double bond, length as m-dash]S substitution. In comparison to the valence (2p)C/(2p)O interactions in C[double bond, length as m-dash]O, the higher 3p orbital of sulfur and its weaker overlap with the 2p level of carbon result in a weaker antibonding interaction in Image ID:d2cp05186a-t1.gif NBO, a prominent contributor to the LUMO. Such an analysis also provides a semi-quantitative understanding of the electronic effect of substituents on or in π-conjugation with a (thio)carbonyl functionality. The intuitive concepts uncovered here offer a simple rule to predict the electronic properties of π-conjugated molecules that incorporate heavy heteroelements and would facilitate materials development.},

The solid-state structures of these molecules feature dipolar C=S (or C=O), chalcogen-bonding, and π-stacking interactions. The presence of two adjacent thiocarbonyl groups allows for a two-center three-electron (2c/3e) interaction upon oxidation, significantly lowering the oxidation potential.},

In the key step for DBA skeleton construction, the bis-C–H olefination products, 1,3-dienes, are utilized as substrates for [4 + 2] cycloaddition with benzyne. This concise synthetic route allows for regioselective ring formation and functional group introduction.

	abstract = {Secondary amines, due to their reactivity, can transform protein templates into catalytically active entities, accelerating the development of artificial enzymes. However, existing methods, predominantly reliant on modified ligands or N-terminal prolines, impose significant limitations on template selection. In this study, genetic code expansion was used to break this boundary, enabling secondary amines to be incorporated into alternative proteins and positions of choice. Pyrrolysine analogues carrying different secondary amines could be incorporated into superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), multidrug-binding LmrR and nucleotide-binding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Notably, the analogue containing a D-proline moiety demonstrated both proteolytic stability and catalytic activity, conferring LmrR and DHFR with the desired transfer hydrogenation activity. While the LmrR variants were confined to the biomimetic 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) as the hydride source, the optimal DHFR variant favorably used the pro-R hydride from NADPH for stereoselective reactions (e.r. up to 92 : 8), highlighting that a switch of protein template could broaden the nucleophile option for catalysis. Owing to the cofactor compatibility, the DHFR-based secondary amine catalysis could be integrated into an enzymatic recycling scheme. This established method shows substantial potential in enzyme design, applicable from studies on enzyme evolution to the development of new biocatalysts.},

	abstract = {Small molecule‐responsive tags for targeted protein degradation are valuable tools for fundamental research and drug target validation. Here, we show that genetically incorporated unnatural amino acids bearing a strained alkene or alkyne functionality can act as a minimalist tag for targeted protein degradation. Specifically, we observed the degradation of strained alkene‐ or alkyne‐containing kinases and E2 ubiquitin‐conjugating enzymes upon treatment with hydrophobic tetrazine conjugates. The extent of the induced protein degradation depends on the identity of the target protein, unnatural amino acid, and tetrazine conjugate, as well as the site of the unnatural amino acid in the target protein. Mechanistic studies revealed proteins undergo proteasomal degradation after tetrazine tethering, and the identity of tetrazine conjugates influences the dependence of ubiquitination on protein degradation. This work provides an alternative approach for targeted protein degradation and mechanistic insight, facilitating the future development of more effective targeted protein degradation strategies.},

The fast TAMM molecules and mild reaction conditions enable site-specific labeling of surface proteins in not only cell lines but also primary neurons and living mice. The combination of genetic code expansion and sequence-specific proteolytic cleavage enables selective modification of three different cell surface proteins through iterative TAMM condensation. TAMM condensation is also compatible with Cu-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition and tetrazine ligation for four-color fluorescent labeling, reaching the maximum available colors of conventional confocal microscopes. Thus, bioconjugation chemistry is no longer the limiting factor for multiplex cell surface protein imaging.},
